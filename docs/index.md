## Welcome to the Brandsen Lab

Thank you for taking the time to vist our website and learn more about our work. We are a research group in the Department of Chemistry at Creighton University interested in using directed evolution to better understand naturally occuring proteins and nucleic acids and to develop new technologies. We are currently interested in evolving peptide natural products with unique structures and chemical properties, developing biosensors for chemical ligands, and better understanding the sequence-function relationship of RNA regulatory elements in their native genomic context.
